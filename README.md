# Bubbles ##
Every one knows, we live in bubbles. Bubbles of friends, co-worker, class-mates, neighborhood and neverless family.
Each bubble has it's own lifecycle, some are public, some private, some are something in between. But personal bubbles don't blow away, the come back. 

And you have more or less the same questions:
* what was the name of that person
* when was the birthday of that person
* was that the husband or wife of ...
* I met you somewhere, but when and where

## Collecting Personal Relationships ##
* Create a bubble
* Add names (persons) to the bubble
* Add relationships of persons
* Add a timeframe to relationships
* Assign a region, timeframe to the bubble

## Keep informed ##
* View calendar with next birthdays
* Get information about class-reunion
* Inform bubbles about birth, marriage or death of other people in the bubble
